jquery-css-transitions
======================

A jQuery plugin for using CSS transitions when available instead of the old animate().

This plugin is meant to be used in replacement of the default '<animate()>' function from **jQuery**.

### Usage ###

The plugin works in the same fashion as the '<css()>' and '<animate()>' functions combined.


## Note ##
From **jQuery 1.8** on you don't need to use this plug-in as the animation engine was totally revamped taking advantage of CSS3 transitions.
